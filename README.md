| 3 | Roman to Integer | String Manipulation, Hash Map | Easy | O(N), where N is the length of the Roman numeral string. The algorithm iterates through the string once.
| 2 | Palindrome Number | Mathematics | Easy | O(log N), where N is the input integer. The number of digits in N is approximately log10(N). In each step of the while loop, we effectively remove one digit from 'x', thus the number of iterations is proportional to the number of digits in N.
