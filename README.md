| Day | Title | Topic | Difficulty | Time Complexity |
|-----|-------|-------|------------|----------------|
| 11 | Sum of Root To Leaf Binary Numbers | Binary Tree, Depth-First Search, Bit Manipulation | Medium | O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is visited exactly once during the Depth-First Search traversal.
| 10 | Valid Palindrome | Strings | Easy | O(N), where N is the length of the input string. In the worst case, both pointers traverse the entire string once.
| 9 | Middle of the Linked List | Linked List | Easy | O(N)
| 8 | Find the Duplicate Number | Arrays, Cycle Detection (Floyd's Tortoise and Hare) | Medium | O(N)
| 7 | Minimum Depth of Binary Tree | Tree, Breadth-First Search (BFS) | Easy | O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. In the worst case, we visit each node exactly once.
| 6 | Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock | Arrays, Greedy | Easy | O(n)
| 5 | Delete Node in a Singly-Linked List (Given Node Only) | Linked List | Medium | O(1)
| 4 | Longest Common Prefix | String Manipulation | Easy | O(N * L_min), where N is the number of strings in the input list, and L_min is the length of the shortest string. In the worst case, we iterate through each character of the shortest string (up to L_min characters), and for each character, we compare it with the corresponding character in all N-1 other strings.
| 3 | Roman to Integer | String Manipulation, Hash Map | Easy | O(N), where N is the length of the Roman numeral string. The algorithm iterates through the string once.
| 2 | Palindrome Number | Mathematics | Easy | O(log N), where N is the input integer. The number of digits in N is approximately log10(N). In each step of the while loop, we effectively remove one digit from 'x', thus the number of iterations is proportional to the number of digits in N.
| 2 | Palindrome Number | Mathematics | Easy | O(log N), where N is the input integer. The number of digits in N is approximately log10(N). In each step of the while loop, we effectively remove one digit from 'x', thus the number of iterations is proportional to the number of digits in N.
| 1 | Two Sum | Arrays, Hash Tables | Easy | O(n)
