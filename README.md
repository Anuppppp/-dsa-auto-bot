| 5 | Delete Node in a Singly-Linked List (Given Node Only) | Linked List | Medium | O(1)
| 4 | Longest Common Prefix | String Manipulation | Easy | O(N * L_min), where N is the number of strings in the input list, and L_min is the length of the shortest string. In the worst case, we iterate through each character of the shortest string (up to L_min characters), and for each character, we compare it with the corresponding character in all N-1 other strings.
| 3 | Roman to Integer | String Manipulation, Hash Map | Easy | O(N), where N is the length of the Roman numeral string. The algorithm iterates through the string once.
| 2 | Palindrome Number | Mathematics | Easy | O(log N), where N is the input integer. The number of digits in N is approximately log10(N). In each step of the while loop, we effectively remove one digit from 'x', thus the number of iterations is proportional to the number of digits in N.
